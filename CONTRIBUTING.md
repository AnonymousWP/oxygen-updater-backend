## Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the backend of Oxygen Updater.
To keep things organized, there are some rules which you'll need to follow:

- The code must run locally, either via Docker or manual web server
- Adding or removing *fields* to existing API calls is **not** possible due to strict JSON mapping in the apps (except for /updateData)
- Adding new *endpoints* to existing API calls *is* possible


Please describe your changes in the PR message.
If the PR is approved, it will be merged and deployed to the application server.
